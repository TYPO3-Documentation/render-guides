Toolbox for render-guides CLI operations
========================================

You can also require this package in your composer.json::

    composer req t3docs/typo3-guides-cli

This package uses the `phpDocumentor Guides <https://github.com/phpDocumentor/guides>`__
for parsing and rendering restructuredText.

This repository is a subtree-split of the monorepo located at
https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/render-guides/tree/main/packages/typo3-guides-cli

The toolbox allows to perform :bash:`guides.xml` migration and linting and
programmatic configuration of the file.
