===============================================

This theme is still in experimantal stage and not used for rendering
https://docs.typo3.org .

You can find an example on how to use this theme in the
`TYPO3 Docs RST-Rendering Demo <https://github.com/TYPO3-Documentation/rst-rendering-demo>`

You can also require this theme in your composer.json::

    composer req t3docs/typo3-docs-theme

This theme uses the `phpDocumentor Guides <https://github.com/phpDocumentor/guides>`__
for parsing and rendering restructuredText.

The theme needs to receive a GIT tag to be pushed to the split
repositories, and also published on the CDN.
