Typesetting H2
==============

Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical
types[1] or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols
(called sorts in mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems)
are retrieved and ordered according to a language's orthography for
visual display.

  font (which is widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for
  typeface). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of
  works could be spotted more easily; making it difficult for copiers who
  have not gained permission.
