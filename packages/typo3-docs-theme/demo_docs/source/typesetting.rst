Typesetting H2
==============

Typesetting is the composition of text by means of arranging physical
types[1] or the digital equivalents. Stored letters and other symbols
(called sorts in mechanical systems and glyphs in digital systems)
are retrieved and ordered according to a language's orthography for

  font (which is widely but erroneously confused with and substituted for
  typeface). One significant effect of typesetting was that authorship of
