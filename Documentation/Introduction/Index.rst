Introduction
============

This is the documentation rendering tool for TYPO3 projects. It is based on
`phpDocumentor/guides`_ and can be used as a drop-in replacement for Sphinx.
The tool is used by the automated documentation rendering system of the
TYPO3 project. And can be used by documentation authors to validate their
documentation.

..  note::

    This tool is still in development, there will be bugs and missing features.
    If you are looking for the current way to render documentation head over to
    :ref:`How to document <h2document:start>`.
